# GTSeq2Midi
A tool that can convert Gran Turismo sequence files to MIDI!

This project utilizes the midifile library by craigsapp: https://github.com/craigsapp/midifile

## Compatibility
So far I can confirm compatibility with:
- Gran Turismo 2
- Gran Turismo 3 (multi sequence file music.seq)

Gran Turismo 1 requires research of the GT-ARC format first but from preliminary tests it is unfortunately buggy and needs fixing.
I can confirm it uses the same format (SEQG).

## Documentation
Docs about the format are coming soon!

## Demonstration
If you're interested, take a listen here: https://soundcloud.com/xanvier/sets/gran-turismo-2-high-quality

## MIDI conversions
You can find my MIDIs I used to render the SoundCloud tracks with in the respective folders. 

They're made to be played on a SC-VA VST but you can play it on any SC-8820 compatible synth and it should sound right.
