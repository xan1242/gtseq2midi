# GTSeq2Midi
A tool that can convert Gran Turismo sequence files to MIDI!

This project utilizes the midifile library by craigsapp: https://github.com/craigsapp/midifile

## Compatibility
It was only tested with Gran Turismo 2's files so far, so there could be some bugs with other games that use the same format.

## Documentation
Docs about the format are coming soon!

## Demonstration
